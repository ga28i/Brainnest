      Most tarts these days are on the sweet side, such as lemon meringue tarts
      and Portuguese egg tarts. However, some types of savory tarts like the
      quiche are also commonly found in bakeries and cafes. Enjoying some
      store-bought tarts is one of life's simple pleasures, but the thought of
      trying to bake a tart yourself might seem like a daunting task, especially
      if youâ€™ve only tried making cookies and brownies.Hundreds of tart
      varieties exist around the world. They can be sweet or savoury, and they
      also vary in size and filling. Here are some of the most common types of
      tarts, classified based on their fillings. Although their fillings vary,
      these tarts have something in common. Most tart crusts are made using
      shortcrust pastry, where the amount of fat is half the flour used in the
      recipe.
