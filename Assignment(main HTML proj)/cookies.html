      The word cookie refers to "small cakes" derived from the Dutch word
      "koekje" or "koekie." Cookies contain many of the same ingredients as
      cakes except that they have a lower proportion of liquid with a higher
      proportion of sugar and fat to flour. Cookie recipes can be prepared in
      myriad shapes, flavors and textures, and can be decorated. Every country
      seems to have its favorite: in North America it's the chocolate chip; in
      the United Kingdom it's shortbread; in France, it's sables and macarons;
      and it's biscotti in Italy.
