      The word "biscuit" is derived from the Latin panis biscoctus, "twice-baked
      bread." From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, forms of the word
      included besquite and bisket. Similar forms are noted in many European
      languages. "Biscuit" covers a wide range of flour baked products, though
      it is generally an unleavened cake or bread, crisp and dry in nature, and
      in a small, thin, and flat shape. It has a number of cultural meanings. In
      the United States, a biscuit is a soft, thick scone product or a small
      roll similar to a muffin. The British biscuit is equivalent to the
      American cookie and cracker. These latter terms are relatively modern.
      "Cookie" comes from the eighteenth-century Dutch word koekje, a diminutive
      of koek (cake). "Cracker" is a North American term that also came into use
      in the eighteenth century, connoting the sound of the wafer as it was
      chewed or broken (at this time, "cracker" was also used to mean a
      firecracker or a noisy person or object). Biscuits have evolved from
      different aspects of baking practices such as tarts, pastries, short
      cakes, and sugar confectionery. They have given rise to the wafer,
      macaroon, cracker, sandwich, snap, gingerbread, honey cake, rusk, and
      water biscuit. Some, like the wafer, were baked in the Middle Ages; others
      are of more recent origin, such as the "fancy biscuit," an
      early-nineteenth-century invention of British bakers that led to the
      development of a biscuit industry, which was later exported throughout the
      world.
