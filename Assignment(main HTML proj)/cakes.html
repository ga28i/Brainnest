    <h1>Cakes</h1>
    <p>
      A basic flour mixture serves as the foundation for sweet and rich cakes
      and what are known as little cakes, called cookies, and their savory
      cousins being quick-breads and yeast breads. Basic ingredients for
      made-from-scratch cake recipes often include flour, sweetener (sugar), fat
      (butter, vegetable oil), liquid (milk), leavening agent (steam, beaten
      eggs, baking powder and/or baking soda), and flavorings (salt, vanilla
      extract). Cakes can also be purchased ready-made or baked with packaged
      mixes that come ready to be combined with water, eggs and vegetable oil.
      Cakes lend themselves to limitless variations depending on the proportion
      of their ingredients, the way they are mixed, flavorings added to the
      basic ingredients, the shapes of the pans used in baking, and cooling and
      storing methods. Any number of fillings, frosting and final decorations
      can be chosen to make every cake unique and an artistic expression of its
      maker.
